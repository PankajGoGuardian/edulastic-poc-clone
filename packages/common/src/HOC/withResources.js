/**
 *  This is an HOC for loading external resources. It also provides a mechanism for handling the mini-meanwhile.
 *  The primary thing here is to make sure no resources are loaded twice. We use a queue and a map to handle this.
 *  Whenever a component needs an extenral resource, its wrapped by this component. If the resources has not yet been
 *  loaded, a "loading-queue" will be created for the resource, and component's "needs" are queued there, and request
 *  for the resource is made. If other components are having same needs meanwhile - during resource is still being fetched-
 *  those are also queued to same queue. Once the resource is obtained all needs will be resolved, and the resource is flagged
 *  as already loaded in the "map". Whenever a component raises a need for external resource, it is first checked against this map!
 *
 *  Ummm... prolly this code belongs to "mines of Moria"! ðŸ‘»
