          ANNEX II – TECHNICAL AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES INCLUDING TECHNICAL
          AND ORGANISATIONAL MEASURES TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF THE DATA
        </h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            Description of the technical and organisational measures implemented
            by the data importer(s) (including any relevant certifications) to
            ensure an appropriate level of security, taking into account the
            nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, and the risks
            for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
          </i>
        </p>
        <h4>Access Control and Management</h4>
        <p>
          We implement lifecycle management practices to ensure that all access
          is promptly terminated when user access is no longer necessary. Only
          authorized users are granted access to our information systems, and
          users are limited to specific defined, documented, and approved levels
          of access rights consistent with the least privilege principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to our information system is granted based on a valid
          need-to-know that is determined by assigned official duties and
          satisfying all personnel security criteria, separation of duties and
          intended system usage. Proper identification and approval is required
          for requests to establish system accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information must be classified and protected according to its risk
          profile. Any data classified as Confidential, Restricted, or with a
          required need for confidentiality or integrity, are stored on
          encrypted systems.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Recovery &amp; Logging</h4>
        <p>
          As part of the our Disaster Recovery Plan, we implement a backup
          solution to protect the availability of its information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We retain system audit logs and records to the extent needed to enable
          the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or
          unauthorized system activity. Network and Host-Based Intrusion
          Detection Systems are to be used, where applicable.
        </p>
        <h4>Configuration and Change Management</h4>
        <p>
          We implement a configuration management plan to meet the compliance
          requirements for each system and a change management program to track,
          review, approve, or disapprove, and log changes. We control and
          monitor user-installed software.
        </p>
        <h4>Incident Response</h4>
        <p>
          Our Incident Response Team responds to security incidents in
          accordance with our Incident Response Plan.
        </p>
        <h4>Media Protection</h4>
        <p>
          We protect removable and portable storage media that stores or
          processes non-public data with necessary measures, such as encryption,
          to ensure non-public data is prohibited from unauthorized access and
          disclosure.{' '}
        </p>
        <h4>Physical Protection</h4>
        <p>
          Our facilities maintain a list of individuals with authorized access
          to our offices. Our facilities and offices are protected by physical
          security measures to ensure information assets are physically
          protected from damage, unauthorized access, theft, and interruptions
          to business processes. Employees will have access to systems and
          facilities removed upon termination of employment.
        </p>
        <h4>Risk &amp; Vulnerability Management</h4>
        <p>
          We, from time to time, identify reasonably foreseeable internal and
          external threats that could result in unauthorized disclosure, misuse,
          alteration, or destruction of organization owned or managed
          information or information systems. Areas of physical, administrative,
          and technical risks are assessed for potential impact and likelihood.
          Security controls in place to mitigate the resultant risks of
          identified threats are evaluated. We regularly conduct vulnerability
          scanning and testing and identify steps to reduce risk.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          The installation of new types of equipment that are not currently on
          the approved list of network devices for our infrastructure network
          must be approved by a group prior to installation.{' '}
        </p>
        <h4>Backups &amp; Recovery: </h4>
        <p>
          We implement a backup solution to protect the availability of its
          information. The frequency of information system backups and the
          transfer rate of backup information to an alternate storage site (if
          so designated) shall be consistent with our recovery objectives and
          internal policies.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          We regularly perform data backups for all appropriate systems. All
          backup solutions and media are tested at least annually or as needed
          to ensure the highest integrity and availability.{' '}
        </p>
        <h4>System and Information Integrity </h4>
        <p>
          All endpoints capable of running anti-virus software must have
          installed company-approved and licensed anti-malware software.
          Vendor-supplied security updates, service packs, and patches are
          implemented on production systems in a timely fashion. Firewalls are
          used to protect the internal network resources from public networks
          such as the Internet.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          We implement an encryption management program to use proven,
          government-approved, FIPS-validated encryption technologies in all IT
          systems that process, store, and transmit non-public data.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          When sensitive information is transmitted over any publicly accessible
          communication network, it must be sent in encrypted form.{' '}
        </p>
        <h4>Training &amp; Compliance</h4>
        <p>
          We conduct an IT Security Awareness and Training program that outlines
          the types and frequency of training sessions for all employees that
          meet organizational, security, compliance, and contractual
          requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are required to observe and follow our policies, standards, and
          procedures at all times. Audits of compliance with this standard are
          performed on a regular basis.{' '}
